* TECHNICAL: Refactored the interface between GUI and backend to allow different backend implementations
* TECHNICAL: Previously, with bundled Python, Thonny was using nasty tricks to force pip install packages install under ~/.thonny. Now it creates a proper virtual environment under ~/.thonny and uses this as the backend by default (instead of using interpreter running the GUI directly).
* TECHNICAL: Automatic tkinter updates on the backend are now less invasive

2.0.7 (2017-01-06)
==================
* FIXED: Making font size too small would crash Thonny.
* FIXED: Another take on configuration file corruption. 
* FIXED: Shift-Tab wasn’t working in some cases.
* FIXED #165: "Open system shell" did not add Scripts dir to PATH in Windows. 
* FIXED #183: ``from __future__ import`` crashed the debugger.

2.0.6 (2017-01-06)
==================
* FIXED: a bug in Linux installer (configuration file wasn’t created in new installations)

2.0.5 (2016-11-30)
==================
* FIXED: Corrected shift key detection (a82bd4d)

2.0.4 (2016-10-26)
==================
* FIXED: Configuration file was occasionally getting corrupted (for mysterious reasons, maybe a bug in Python’s configparser)
* FIXED #104: Negative font size crashed Thonny
* FIXED #143: Linux installer fails if desktop isn't named "Desktop". (Later turned out this wasn't fixed for all cases).
* FIXED #134: "Open system shell" doesn't work in Centos 7 KDE 

2.0.3 (2016-09-30)
==================
* FIXED: Quoting in "Open system shell" in Mac. Again. 

2.0.2 (2016-09-30)
==================
* FIXED: Quoting in "Open system shell" in Mac. 

2.0.1 (2016-09-30)
==================
* FIXED #106: Don't let user logs grow too big

2.0.0 (2016-09-29)
==================
* NEW: Added code completion (powered by Jedi: https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi)
* NEW: Added new command "Tools => Open system shell" which opens terminal where current Python is in PATH.
* CHANGED: Single instance mode is now optional (Tools => Options => General)
* FIXED: Many bugs

1.2.0b2 (2016-02-10)
====================
* NEW: Thonny now runs in single instance mode. Previously, when you opened a py file with Thonny, a new Thonny instance (window) was created even if an instance existed already. This became nuisance if you opened several files. Now Thonny works as single instance program, meaning only one instance of Thonny runs at the time. When you open another file, it is opened in existing window.
* NEW: Editor enhancements. Added option to show line numbers and right margin in the editor. In order to keep first impression cleaner, they are disabled by default. See Tools => Options => Editor. Don't forget that you don't need line numbers for locating lines mentioned in error messages -- you can click them and Thonny shows you the line.
* FIXED: Some bugs where Thonny couldn't prepare some programs for debugging.
